# Star Wars API Demo

This is a simple single page application that uses the Star Wars API (SWAPI) to fetch and display information about the Star Wars universe. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses the `fetch()` method to retrieve data from SWAPI.

## Installation

To run the application, simply clone or download the repository to your local machine and open the `index.html` file in a web browser. 

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/star-wars-api-demo.git`
`cd star-wars-api-demo`
`open index.html`

## Usage

Once you have the application open in your browser, click the "Fetch Star Wars Data" button to retrieve information about a random Star Wars character. The application uses the `fetch()` method to send a request to the SWAPI server and retrieve data in JSON format. The character's name, gender, and birth year are then displayed on the webpage.

You can modify the application to retrieve and display information about other entities in the Star Wars universe such as films, planets, species, and more using the SWAPI documentation.
